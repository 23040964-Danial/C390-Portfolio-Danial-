                <h3>Fundamentals of Design</h3>
                <p>In this project,  I employed Adobe Illustrator to create detailed concept sketches for the website's layout. This involved carefully planning the structure, balance, and hierarchy of elements on each page to enhance usability and visual appeal. Using Illustrator, I could precisely design vector-based sketches that allowed me to explore and refine core design principles, such as alignment, contrast, and spacing. </p>

                <h3>Immersive Technology</h3>
                <p>In this project,  I used Unity to design and build a VR Escape Room game. This project required creating an engaging and realistic virtual environment that fully immerses players in a series of interactive, puzzle-based challenges. Leveraging Unityâ€™s VR tools, I developed dynamic 3D models, realistic textures, and interactive objects that respond to player input, enhancing the sense of presence within the virtual space. By implementing spatial audio, intuitive controls, and realistic physics, I crafted an immersive experience that encourages players to solve puzzles while navigating through a richly detailed environment.</p>
