                    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                    <p>Beyond design, I find inspiration through boxing, which cultivates discipline and focus. I am deeply passionate 
                       about leveraging Figma as a primary design tool, continuously refining my prototyping skills and exploring 
                       innovative design solutions for my academic and personal projects. My commitment to design excellence drives 
                       me to constantly iterate, experiment, and enhance the user experience through meticulous and creative digital 
                       design approaches.</p>

                    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I believe great design is about more than just aestheticsâ€”it's about creating meaningful experiences that solve 
                       user problems efficiently and elegantly. Each project is an opportunity to tell a story and make digital 
                       interactions more intuitive and engaging.</p>
